//DKS - DX8Texture.h is a new file I have added.
//      It contains a new texture system class that allows sprites to share textures,
//      where before the game was loading duplicate copies in places. It also
//      abstracts away the details like the alpha textures needed by ETC1 compression.
//      It also unifies the interface that was once different between DX8 and SDL.

    //       expanded to nearest-power-of-two dimensions on some platforms

    //         texture in VRAM that might have been expanded to npot dimensions.
