
UniquE RAR File Library
=======================

 What is it?
 ===========

  The URARFileLib is a small static library that allows you to read files 
  from RAR archives created with RAR and WinRAR. 

  Listing, decompression, and decryption with full RAR 2.0 compatibility
  is done directly in your application, so there is no need for a DLL 
  or any other external file. 

  It is based on the free unRAR source code by Eugene Roshal, and designed
  for easy but powerful usage in demos, intros and cross-platform applications.
  It is also useful if you  want to port your programs since the it is written
  in ANSI C (some parts are optimized in x86 assembly) and supports multiple 
  operating systems.
