Originally, the game dumped all textures,songs,sfx,levels,etc together
into the data/ subdirectory.

Now, the files are sorted into individual subdirectories
under the data/ subdirectory. Furthermore, many of the original data files
have been converted or updated during the porting process and are no
longer compatible.

The original data files have been archived in the following file:
original_data_files.tar.bz2  MD5SUM: a28e198a3c0d35f3afe192436db4d26e

They should be used for future reference ONLY and are deprecated.
